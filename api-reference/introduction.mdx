## Welcome to Tourshub API Global

Tourshub API Global is a comprehensive tourism platform API that provides booking services, tour management, and partner integrations. This documentation covers all available API endpoints, authentication methods, and integration patterns.

## Base URLs

Our API is organized into several modules with different base URLs:

- **V1 API**: `https://api.tourshub.org/api/` (Main booking and tour management API)
- **Experience Bank Partner API**: `https://experiencebank.tourshub.org/` (Partner integration API)
- **Intranet API**: `https://api.tourshub.org/intranet/` (Internal systems API)
- **Tour CMS Webhooks**: `https://api.tourshub.org/` (CMS integration webhooks)

## Authentication Methods

### JWT Authentication (V1 API)
Most V1 API endpoints use JWT tokens for authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

### Private Token Authentication (Booking Operations)
Sensitive booking operations require private tokens stored in reseller records:

```http
Authorization: YOUR_PRIVATE_TOKEN
```

### HMAC Signature Authentication (Experience Bank Partner API)
Partner API uses HMAC-SHA256 signatures with public/private key pairs:

```http
Authorization: YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY:HMAC_SIGNATURE
X-REQUEST-IDENTIFIER: TIMESTAMP_BASED_IDENTIFIER
```

### Basic Authentication (Intranet API)
Internal API uses basic authentication with secret keys:

```http
Authorization: Basic BASE64_ENCODED_CREDENTIALS
```
